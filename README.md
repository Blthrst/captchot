# Captchot

This is a **simple** captcha bot for your Telegram group. *Captchot* provides basic protection against bots, userbots, flooders and other.

## How it works?

It uses a simple task that is randomly generated to screen out users. 

If a user fails to solve the task within a certain time, the bot bans that user.

Remember that in order for the bot to work in your Telegram group, it must have administrator rights.

## I want to use Catchot!
